# BreakOverlap

## Algorithm description and illustration
The implementation takes break time inputs and for each break time creates two time markers on a timeline: start time and end time. All the markers are ordered by ascending time value, and if the value is equal, start markes are placed first. After the splitting and sorting it is not distinguishable which markers formed a single initial input (and it is not important for the algorithm).
